- **API Integration**: RESTful API for seamless integration with existing systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend (Flask)

- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for the API
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions
- **JWT**: Authentication and authorization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for forecasting models
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis

### Frontend (React)

- **React**: UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling

### DevOps

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Nginx**: Web server and reverse proxy

## üìä Data Science Approach

### Forecasting Methodology

The system uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict future sales based on historical data. The forecasting process includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Time series decomposition
   - Feature engineering (week number, year, etc.)
   - Handling of seasonality and trends

2. **Model Training**:
   - Weekly automated model training
   - Product-specific models for accurate predictions
   - Hyperparameter optimization

3. **Prediction Generation**:
   - Confidence intervals for predictions
   - Multi-week forecasting horizon
   - Accuracy metrics tracking

### Data Engineering Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Sales data captured through API endpoints
2. **Data Storage**: Structured in PostgreSQL with optimized schema
3. **ETL Process**: Automated data transformation for model training
4. **Model Persistence**: Trained models saved for future predictions
5. **Scheduled Jobs**: Automated weekly retraining and forecasting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
